      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commercial derivative works.</strong> Commercial derivative works of arkOS, including hardware bundled with arkOS software or third-party online services marketed to arkOS customers, is permitted with certain conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>You may not use a name for your company or commercial product containing the words "ark" or "arkOS"; rather you can make a product and explain that it "works with arkOS", "runs arkOS", "is compatible with arkOS", etc.</li>
            <li>We encourage use of the "Powered by arkOS" logo, <a href="https://cdn.citizenweb.io/static/img/powered-by-arkos.png">available here</a>, for mentions of the arkOS brand in conjunction with your product. You may not manufacture or sell physical or software products with the regular arkOS logo on the product itself or on its packaging.</li>
            <li>Your use of the word "ark", the arkOS name or "Powered by arkOS" logo anywhere in your product must not be intended to confuse people about what arkOS actually is, and such use must not imply endorsement of the derivative work by CitizenWeb or arkOS or affiliation in any way.</li>
            <li>Any appearance of the arkOS name or "Powered by arkOS" image in online promotional materials should be linked to the arkOS project website at <a href="https://arkos.io">https://arkos.io</a>. Offline promotional materials should include the URL of "https://arkos.io" somewhere near the logo.</li>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Non-commercial derivative works.</strong> Non-commercial derivative works of arkOS, including open source software intended for use on arkOS, are welcomed. We encourage derivative works to make use of the "Powered by arkOS" logo <a href="https://cdn.citizenweb.io/static/img/powered-by-arkos.png">available here</a>, instead of using the arkOS logo in any marketing or promotional materials. Use of the arkOS trademarks and brand is permitted, as long as such use does not imply endorsement of the derivative work by CitizenWeb or arkOS in any way.</li>
        <li><strong>Commentary.</strong> We encourage individuals to use the arkOS trademarks to write about arkOS and to provide commentary or news about the platform, as long as said commentary or news does not imply endorsement by CitizenWeb or arkOS of any other medium, product or organization not associated with arkOS. In the same way, the arkOS trademarks and brand may be used in non-commercial satirical speech in keeping with the laws and regulations of the country of origin, provided such speech does not also contravene any other guideline listed here.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>CitizenWeb reserves the right to restrict use of the arkOS trademarks and brand if a project, company or individual is found to be using said trademarks or brand outside of the above guidelines or the spirit of fairness established therein.</p>
