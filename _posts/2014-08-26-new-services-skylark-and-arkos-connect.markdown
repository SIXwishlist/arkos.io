Behind the hard work we've been doing to shore up improvements to arkOS in its Beta phase, we've also been planning new services to further improve the self-hosting experience for our users. Today we're pleased to announce the result of these plans: [Skylark](https://getskylark.com), a provider of arkOS virtual personal clouds; and [arkOS CONNECT](https://connect.arkos.io), a suite of services to aid those running arkOS on their own hardware.

## About Skylark

Skylark is our premium service for those looking for a private and easy-to-use personal cloud, but without the fuss of self-hosting on your home Internet connection. A virtual private server (VPS) running arkOS, Skylark promises a dead simple interface, fast operation, and respect for your privacy. Your websites, emails, cloud data and more will be accessible to you from anywhere in the world, with assured dependability. You'll also be able to choose between a European or North American datacenter for storing your cloud.

Get more information about Skylark at the website, https://getskylark.com.

*Skylark is an independent entity from the CitizenWeb Project: it will be used to support some of the work we do on arkOS, but it will not bear any financial or organizational control over arkOS.*

## About arkOS CONNECT

arkOS CONNECT is an ideal supplement for people who prefer to use arkOS from their own hardware, at home and on their own Internet connection. This affords a higher level of control to the user, and is better for applications that require heavy data transfer and media sharing on one's local network. Some services may not work flawlessly from a home Internet connection, however, so arkOS CONNECT is there as an optional suite to give you additional control.

arkOS CONNECT will include three packages to mix-and-match as you see fit:

 - **DelugeDNS** allows you to connect to your arkOS web services from anywhere in the world, with a dependable and secure backbone, regardless of the state of your home Internet connection. Use with your own domain or as a subdomain on a shared service. Supports both HTTP and HTTPS.
 - Combine the advantages of decentralized mail storage with the dependability of a hosted mail service. **arkOS Mail** securely transports incoming and outgoing mail from your arkOS device to the greater Internet. Mail is stored on your device, under your control, and there is no need to worry about port blockages or downtime. Use with your own domain or add accounts to a shared service.
 - **Drydock** is a redundant online warehouse for saving your stuff: whether it's individual files, data from your services, or full system backups. Files are encrypted on your arkOS device before being stored for maximum security -- we couldn't open them even if we tried. Rest assured knowing you'll never lose what's important to you.

You will also be able to register for domains and SSL certificates and have them instantly assigned to your device(s) from within Genesis as a CONNECT subscriber!

The site and promotional materials for arkOS CONNECT can be found [on its website](https://connect.arkos.io), with **full integration in Genesis 0.7**, so keep an eye on our social media feeds for more information!

## So what's the big idea?

The big idea is to give users more options than they have now. More people need to be self-hosting but more people also *need the ability* to self-host, as not all do. We're breaking down the education and time barriers just by producing arkOS, and now we'd like to tackle the other barriers in the process as well. And the hope is that, with the additional funds we can pull in, we will be able to support the open source and community-benefitting work that we are doing every day with arkOS, without constantly begging for donations or being beholden to venture capital.

## Timelines

We're working hard to make arkOS CONNECT's first service, DelugeDNS, operational before the end of 2014. Additional services like arkOS Mail and Drydock will be available in Q1 2015 if not before.

Skylark will enter a Beta run with a limited subset of users in November. The full launch will depend on how well the Beta goes, but we are working for Q1 2015.

On the [Skylark website](https://getskylark.com) you can sign up to receive more information for when Skylark will be available, and for a chance to participate in the Beta if you are interested.

Development of arkOS will continue side-by-side with the addition of these new services. The Roadmap page includes our latest view of how this will go, as well as what features to expect by when.

## Our Commitment to Users

As we've stated many times in many ways over the past few months, you can count on us to:

 - keep the use of arkOS free and open forever;
 - prioritize development of open source components above paid services; and
 - use paid services only as a support for arkOS' development, rather than it's sole driver.


## Input Wanted

If you have any questions or comments regarding these new services, we'd love to hear from you. Feel free to leave your comments on this thread or share them with us by another means.

Thank you so much for your continued support.
