*This is a series of posts by arkOS users and enthusiasts published in advance of the release of the latest version, 0.7 "Noah". The following post is from arkOS user and all-around awesome person [Chris Sikkenga](http://www.sikkdays.me). If you would like to contribute your thoughts about arkOS and write a post about what it means to you, please [get in touch](mailto:jacob@citizenweb.io).*

A user-friendly way to host your own data is the primary goal of arkOS, but in a way I think it could be a gateway drug. See, it is not only a powerful tool to self-host but a beacon of shining light on all the great projects and applications that don't have the marketing budget of Dropbox or Evernote.  Getting that taste of what is possible thanks to arkOS will drive us to seek out better solutions and possibly demand more from ourselves.

I am not a developer. I use a Linux terminal with the training wheels of the web. I do have experience hosting sites and I know enough HTML & CSS to hurt myself. I liked the idea of hosting my own data in this world, where my right to privacy is being violated by my own government and marketing companies follow me around the web like perverted stalkers. Thus, I supported the [fundraising campaign for arkOS](https://fund.arkos.io/) to ensure that I got an SD card with version 0.5 and a case. Like many others I found [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/) sluggish and not responsive enough. Whether it was the hardware or the Internet connection the Raspberry Pi was behind, using ownCloud led me to [the forums](https://bbs.arkos.io/t/seafile-instead-of-owncloud/303/20) where people were discussing [SeaFile](http://seafile.com/en/home/). [Following tutorials](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) I installed Raspian on an SD card and eventually got SeaFile up and running. I would have never learned about it had I not tried arkOS.

This is the hidden power of the project, the ability to motivate individuals to find personalized solutions and retain his or her rights and privacy *if they choose*. Many companies use us as leverage to grab more users and data. "Would you like to see pictures from my recent trip to Vancouver? No problem, I've posted them on Facebook." There is a problem, you've got to be a member of Facebook to see them. Not to mention that I signed away the rights to my photos when I joined FB. Using arkOS, you can share photos in a number of ways. For example, [Lychee](http://lychee.electerious.com/) would allow you to make a gallery to share. Lychee may not be the solution for everyone. Perhaps I want something to also share video and audio. This might lead me to [MediaGoblin](http://www.mediagoblin.org/). While some day it may find itself included in arkOS, right now I can follow [some instructions](https://gobblin.se/u/joar/m/gnu-mediagoblin-on-a-raspberry-pi/) and try it out myself. I can distribute my own audio & video files and retain the rights to my work.

Speaking of audio, music is a good example of what I see in arkOS. Years ago, record companies were the gatekeepers. Radio play, recording and album sales were entirely controlled by the record companies. As recording equipment moved from analog to digital, prices dropped which allowed bands & individuals to record better demos or even distribute their work easier. Now there's desktop recording software, websites to distribute your work and thousands of artists making a living producing and selling their music without the record company. When it comes to publishing on the web, I see arkOS as that middle stage when recording moved from analog to digital. The OS allows us to take more control over our data. Like the many musicians who don't want to take on distribution or sales and just need that decent recording to get discovered, arkOS is perfect for users who want to publish free of the chains of Google and other data collection/marketing companies masquerading as useful internet services. Eventually, users may find themselves looking for more customization and leasing a cloud server from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) and exploring their own solutions. Maybe it even leads to users learning to code their own apps or modify existing open source projects.

In a world where we have information at our fingertips, finding the best solution is as easy as asking the question and following a tutorial. In the time it takes you to give away your personal information, read the terms of service and sign your rights away, you could be learning something new and creating a personalized service. I know that arkOS has opened my eyes to a number of fantastic projects.

> Learning how to use [...] software for my needs, rather than serving the desires of cloud corporations, is far more rewarding.

Most people use Windows, Android, Facebook and Google because that's what the majority is using. It's not a choice because they are unaware of the possibilities. I just imagine a ten year old girl getting a Raspberry Pi and arkOS as a birthday gift. After spending a few weeks learning about the available apps and publishing online, she starts learning Linux, finding new projects and maybe she eventually starts creating her own. It could happen. This 40 year old man got his for Christmas of 2013 and now, in addition to his Raspberry Pi, he has an old laptop with Linux for hosting experiments and another Raspberry Pi on the way. Jacob Cook's arkOS has given me the ability to host my own data, but it has also inspired me to educate myself. For me, arkOS is a portal to the collaborative world of open source software development. Learning how to use that software for my needs, rather than serving the desires of cloud corporations, is far more rewarding.
