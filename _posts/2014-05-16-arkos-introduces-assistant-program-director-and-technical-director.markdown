Last month I had the immense privilege of welcoming Tom Atkins to the CitizenWeb Project as Assistant Program Director. He brings a great deal of experience and enthusiasm for the lofty goals that arkOS seeks to tackle.

Tom said in his introduction post:

> "There are ambitious plans for arkOS. It will soon support more powerful hardware and will offer an ever increasing range of applications. My role is to help the arkOS community get the most out of the system. This means doing things like helping and listening to users, encouraging people who would like to contribute to the project, and developing collaborations with other groups working towards a decentralized Internet. I’ve worked in universities and colleges in the UK and Ireland where I’ve been responsible for delivering eLearning projects, web services and IT training. Building a community and getting people together to make software that’s easy and enjoyable to use is a complex and delicate task. I’m bringing the experience gained with these previous projects to help build on the incredible work that Jacob has started."

The two are now hard at work for arkOS and you will see them making posts on the blog and in the forums. Feel free to send them any questions or comments you have!
