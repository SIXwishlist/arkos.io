Due to popular demand and an ongoing need to improve and expand arkOS’ documentation, a [Wiki has been set up](https://wiki.arkos.io/) for the project to use going forward. Over time, this wiki will be linked into the main project website in place of the existing documentation. The main website will stay in place to host non-documentation-related resources such as the Downloads page, package list and much more.

**The project needs your help in order to maintain succinct and comprehensive yet effective documentation.** Here are the areas in which you can help:

 * Add your favourite device to the list of devices that will be supported in the future. Include some basic information about your device, including how you were able to get arkOS working on it (if you were at all). You can use the existing device page for the Raspberry Pi as a guide.
 * Make improvements to existing documentation on Genesis core features and Genesis plugins.
 * If you’ve figured out how to do something cool with arkOS, but it doesn’t exactly belong on the official Device page or the entry for the relevant Genesis plugin: create your own HOWTO articles by linking them to the appropriate category. (Make sure to preface the title with “HOWTO.”)

As you make your contributions, please keep the wiki clean. Check for articles that already exist on a subject before you create a new one. And always make sure to use the proper category headings when you create new articles, so that people can easily find them.

Thank you!
