Weâ€™re pleased to announce that default installation images are now available for the Cubieboard2 and Cubietruck platforms! Thanks to the hard work of volunteer testers, you can now enjoy the full arkOS alpha experience, with Genesis and all, on these more powerful platforms. Split boot/data images have also been released, allowing you to install your boot partition on a microSD card and the root data partition on a USB drive, allowing for more space and stability for your embedded server.

To install these images, you will need to download them manually from the [Downloads page](/download), as the Installer is not yet updated to take advantage of them. (Installer updates are delayed as Genesis 0.6 is taking priority, and as the Installer will be undergoing a major rewrite/update in the coming weeks/months which we are very excited about!)

An image for the **BeagleBone Black** is also in the works and will be placed on the Downloads page once testing is complete.

These are the first officially supported ARMv7 images to be produced by arkOS, thanks in large part to the financial support of contributor **Caleb Cooper**. Thank you Caleb!
