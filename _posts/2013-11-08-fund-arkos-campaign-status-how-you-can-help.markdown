I wanted to take an opportunity to thank you for the support you’ve shown for the arkOS crowdfunding campaign so far. With your help, we’ve reached 10% funding in just a few days!

If we are to have any hope of making our full goal, we need some media coverage, which we have not had yet. Decentralization and self-hosting aren’t the most glamorous things in the world, but they are critically important for the future of our Internet. I’m working night and day to make this happen, but I cannot do it alone. I need each and every one of you to share, like, post, tweet the heck out of this page so that the media will stand up and take notice of us. EVERY share will help us get one step closer to our goal.

If you are looking for a bit more substance to share with the link, I wrote a piece the other day for Medium on how decentralization is critically important for the future Web. This might help people understand why arkOS is so important. That article can be found here: [https://medium.com/surveillance-state/883a3cffb4b0](https://medium.com/surveillance-state/883a3cffb4b0)

Thank you so much for your support, together we can get arkOS funded!
