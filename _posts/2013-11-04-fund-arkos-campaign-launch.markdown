Several months ago I started working on this project in my free time, not sure if it would go anywhere, with just an idea in my head and many conversations with other people in the decentralized tech field. The project has grown by leaps and bounds since, with several alpha versions of its core software released, sketches of groundbreaking future features to be developed and included, and the formation of a passionate community of early adopters and bugtesters.

Today marks a turning point in the course of the arkOS project. In order to support future development and stable processing of new features in the short and long term, I am happy to announce that I have launched the **[Fund arkOS](https://fund.arkos.io/)** campaign. This campaign is a Kickstarter-style crowdfunding effort, with different reward levels based on your giving ability and your interest in the project. You can get anything from a sticker, an awesome t-shirt from your choice of three designs, a custom Raspberry Pi case, or even complete ready-to-go Raspberry Pi packages including everything you need to get started with arkOS!

Make note that there is an **EARLY BIRD Special** which will run ONLY until November 10th: Contributions of $100 will get an arkOS sticker, a special edition arkOS Raspberry Pi plastic case, and your pick from three designs for an awesome t-shirt to show your support.

Even if you are not able to contribute financially, sharing the crowdfunding page with your friends and family will make a huge impact for what this campaign is able to accomplish. I encourage everyone to use the share links included on the [Fund arkOS](https://fund.arkos.io/) page, and spread the word far and wide across your social networks.

Thanks to everyone for your support and encouragement as the project enters this new phase!
