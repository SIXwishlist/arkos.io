We’re excited to be attending [Indie Tech Summit][its] in Brighton, UK on 4th and 5th July 2014.

If you’re nearby then do try and come along, it should be a great event – Richard Stallman will be there!

On the Friday there are lots of talks, including a demo of the soon to be released arkOS 0.6, and then on Saturday there will be workshops where you’ll get an extended chance to discuss personal servers and arkOS with Tom.

We’ll report back here next week on how the event goes.
