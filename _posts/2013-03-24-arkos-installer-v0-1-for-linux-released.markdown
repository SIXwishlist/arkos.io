The first release of the arkOS Installer for Linux is now available for download on the website. This installer will allow you choose one of two download mirrors to grab the latest image of the arkOS distribution, then it will download it and write it automatically to a connected device of your choosing. Future versions will also include the capability to set up an initial user, make advanced network configuration, change the timezone and region settings, and much much more.

A .deb package for use with Ubuntu, Debian or their derivatives [is available here](https://pkg.arkos.io/resources/arkos-install-latest.deb), while the source Python files can be run on any other distribution and [are available here](https://pkg.arkos.io/resources/arkos-install-latest.tar.gz). Packages for other distributions will be uploaded in the coming days, and versions for Mac OS X and Windows are forthcoming.

If you use the installer and find any bugs, please submit a bug report at [our issue tracker](https://github.com/cznweb/arkos-install/issues), or send us a message via the contact form above. For a full list of features, see the [changelog](/dev/changelogs).
