Happy new year to all arkOS supporters! Thanks to you, today marks the first day that I am officially working on this project as a full-time endeavour. 2014 will indeed be the year of arkOS, and there are many exciting things in the works.

Below is a big progress update on the project, the funding campaign, and a brief look ahead to what is coming up in the next few weeks and months. Enjoy!

### Project Update

December may have been a holiday month, but that doesn’t mean that work on the project was at a standstill. LOTS of exciting things were added in the runup to Christmas that you may have missed:

 * [A roadmap page was added to the site](https://arkos.io/dev/roadmap). This page will be frequently updated to track expected release dates and features for each release.
 * A Vagrant VM image was added to quickly get started with Genesis testing or development. This VM image runs Arch Linux and is configured to run Genesis automatically. You can get it from [the Downloads page](/download).
 * The arkOS Installer for Linux and OS X released [version 0.3.1](https://arkos.io/downloads). This version includes bugfixes, faster writing to disk in OS X, translations in many languages including German French Spanish and much more, and the OS X version of the app is now signed to prevent annoying security errors.
 * A [new Wiki has been setup](https://wiki.arkos.io) for documentation of the project. Now everyone can add their notes and instructions for getting arkOS to work on various devices. And multilingual support for translating the documentation is in the works.
 * Work has been underway on Genesis: general framework progress has been made, the beginnings of a TinyTinyRSS plugin and a Poche webreader plugin too.
 * Two new mirrors were added: Paris and Taipei. They join the original official mirrors in New York and Amsterdam, and the existing community mirrors in Frankfurt, Orlando, and Vienna.


### Order Status

Here are a few important things to note:

 * Supplies for the orders have been ordered from the respective suppliers and should be arriving here shortly. Most orders will be shipped out over the course of the month of January. Some orders may not make it out (or arrive) until February, but rest assured that I’m working as hard as I can to get them to you in a timely manner.
 * The address listed on your order will be the one supplied when you filled out the order. If you used PayPal, this will be the primary shipping address on your account. If for some reason you need to give a new address, please contact [fund@citizenweb.is](mailto:fund@citizenweb.is) **as soon as possible** so the address labels will be printed correctly.
 * Make sure to **check the confirmation email** that you received after your order was submitted to confirm your reward level and other details are correct. If you would like to make a change to your order, such as changing the reward level, please contact [fund@citizenweb.is](mailto:fund@citizenweb.is) immediately. **Order changes cannot be accepted after January 6th.**
 * The version of Genesis that will be sent out on the SD cards will be a special release called 0.4.2. This is a stable preview version of 0.5 – it will have some of the features scheduled for release in 0.5, and an update feature to move you along to new releases of Genesis when they are pushed out. This is being done due to the time constraints of having everything shipped out in sync with each other.
 * Reminder that returns will only be accepted in the case of defective electronic material being sent out, such as a defective Raspberry Pi. If this is the case, please let us know as soon as possible and we will send you a replacement. Refunds will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and can only be guaranteed if for some reason we cannot fulfill on shipping your reward.


### A Look Ahead

Here are some of the things you can look forward to in the coming weeks and months:

 * The written specification for the arkOS email system(s) will be ready for publication by mid-January. Then they can be reviewed or discussed by interested developers.
 * Genesis 0.5 is in active development, a preview release (0.4.2) will be ready by mid-January with the official release soon thereafter.
 * Multiplatform support is coming soon – a new build system is being developed to facilitate this, and armv7 support should be in place before March. That means being able to use arkOS on your Beagleboards, Cubieboards, etc. will soon be possible!

I hope everyone has a great start to their New Year and thanks again for your support for the project!
