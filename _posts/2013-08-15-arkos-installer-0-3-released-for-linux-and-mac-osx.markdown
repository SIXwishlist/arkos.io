A new version of the Installer has been released for Linux and Mac OS X. This new version features a **Network Browser** feature, showing the IP addresses of all Raspberry Pis on your local network. This means that, if accessing Genesis via `http://arkOS:8000` does not work due to DNS issues, you can still access it via its IP address in the place of “arkOS”. Coming soon, the **Beacon** utility will also be installed on arkOS servers, allowing you to shutdown, reboot or reload Genesis remotely from the Network Browser interface.

The Installer also features bugfixes and stability improvements to its download and installation system, as well as being completely rewritten in a new graphical interface that improves its cross-platform compatibility.

Check out the [Downloads](/download) section to find these new installers. A Windows version is in the works and should also be released within a few days.
