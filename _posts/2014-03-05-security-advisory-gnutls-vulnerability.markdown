A critical vulnerability has been found and fixed in a popular cryptographic library for Linux. GnuTLS has been updated to 3.2.12, fixing a serious vulnerability. arkOS users are encouraged to update this package via the Package Management plugin of Genesis as soon as possible.

> “It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker.”
