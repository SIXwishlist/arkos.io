Dear arkOS supporters, fans and users,

We're hard at work on arkOS 0.6 which will be our first 'beta' release. The web interface will be easier to use, apps will be simpler to install and we're focusing on making existing applications and services more stable.

But 0.6 is really just the start – we’re super excited about the future of arkOS to help make self hosting so simple that anyone can do it!

There's so much to do that we need to prioritize what to work on. We’d be extremely grateful if you would take a few minutes to answer the questions below.

Thank you!
Tom and Jacob at arkOS.
