**Who:** The Open Internet Tools Project ([OpenITP](http://openitp.org/))

**What:** “Techno-Activism Third Mondays (TA3M) is an informal meetup designed to connect software creators and activists who are interested in censorship, surveillance, and open technology. Currently, TA3M are held in 9 cities throughout the world, with many more launching in the near the future.”

**When:** Monday July 15th, from 18h00 to about 20h30 (or later if you stay!)

**Where:** Station C – 5605 avenue de Gaspé, Ste 204, Montréal H2T 2A4

**Why:** Come enjoy a night of discussion and brain-picking with fellow internet users, enthusiasts, activists and developers of all kinds. This month’s edition in Montréal will be led with a talk by anarcat concerning the NSA’s PRISM program, a forum to get up-to-date on the latest developments, to ask questions and discuss your concerns with like-minded individuals.

I will also be presenting a talk on arkOS! This talk will include a brief overview of the project, why it is important, its different components both planned and future, updates on the development status AND a live demonstration of the newest version of Genesis prior to its release. There will be plenty of time for questions about the project, how it is developed and how it might help protect users against surveillance and allow them to reassert sovereignty over their data.

Anyone in the Montréal area is strongly encouraged to attend! You won’t be disappointed. For more information, [visit the wiki](http://wiki.openitp.org/events:techno-activism_3rd_mondays:montreal) or see the [EventBrite page to register](https://ta3mmontreal.eventbrite.com/).
