One year ago today, arkOS started as a concept for a set of setup scripts for creating self-hosted servers on the Raspberry Pi. This past year has seen a huge evolution from that point. Forking Genesis to create a high-level server manager and GUI, setting up an installer, and managing the other important aspects of an operating system project, such as documentation and a community site. Running a wildly successful crowdfunding campaign to propel its development to the next level was one of the highlights of the year. Today the project is now a full-time endeavour to create the first easy-to-use visual server operating system, primarily intended for embedded devices. On behalf of the project I’d like to thank everyone who has supported arkOS, physically, financially and emotionally. Without all of your support it would never have reached this goal.

Here’s to many more successful birthdays for arkOS!
