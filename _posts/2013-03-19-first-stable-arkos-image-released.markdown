The first stable image of arkOS has been released and is ready for download. You can now snag the images in either .tar.gz or .zip format. Both are roughly the same size. You can find them on the download page or linked just below:

### [Download (.tar.gz)](https://uspx.ark-os.org/latest.tar.gz)     -or-     [Download (.zip)](https://uspx.ark-os.org/latest.zip)

This release is the first that has been natively prepared and compiled. It is a high-performance image, launching in only ~3 seconds at boot. There were several bugfixes and convention changes in this newest version, and the base has been updated to the latest versions of all software. For information on how to install it, head to the updated [Getting Started](/getting-started) page.

### Repo Updates

The package repositories have been updated in this latest release. For one, the location has changed. They are now located at https://uspx.ark-os.org/. This is made so that they can be distinguished from the European repositories which will be launched soon. Secondly, more packages have been added to add support for servers as well as additional general-purpose software. More packages are being added all the time.

### Next Steps

As the base image has reached a stable point, the focus will now shift on developing the arkOS Installer. The first version of the Installer for Linux is expected to be complete by the end of March, with versions for Mac OS X and Windows appearing sometime after (possibly in April).

New installation images will be released occasionally to fix random bugs, to improve base software offerings, or to periodically update the software base. As arkOS is a rolling-release distribution, you will only need to install these images when you first set up the software; after that, you receive your software updates continuously via pacman. Depending on how many changes occur, you can expect an updated installation image every 3-4 months.

As always, contact me if you have any questions or comments about arkOS, or if you wish to find out how you can become more involved with the project. Volunteers are welcome!
