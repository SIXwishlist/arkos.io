<p><strong>Vagrant</strong> is a system to allow the rapid setup and deployment of virtual machines (VMs) for testing purposes. Vagrant VMs (or &#8216;boxes&#8217;) can be shared between individuals to have a common starting point when developing software for certain platforms. arkOS has created and uploaded a Vagrant box running Arch Linux and custom-fitted with Genesis and all of its required dependencies. All that remains is to install Vagrant, download and enable the Vagrant box, then sign in to start development for Genesis &#8211; very easy!</p>

<h3>Getting Started with Vagrant</h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t already have Vagrant on your system, it&#8217;s easy to install. <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads">Download the latest version of Vagrant</a> for your current operating system or Linux distro</p>
<p>See <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2">the Vagrant documentation</a> for more general information about using Vagrant.</p>

<h3>Installing the Arch/Genesis Vagrant Box</h3>
<p>Install a base Arch environment with Genesis by downloading the Vagrant box <a href="/download">from the Downloads page</a>, moving the box to a new folder and running the following commands from that folder:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Initialize the Vagrant box
vagrant init genesis-dev genesis-dev.box

# Extract, configure and boot (will take a few minutes)
vagrant up

# SSH into the Vagrant VM
vagrant ssh

# (from inside the VM) Run Genesis live in stdout. First start will take a minute or two.
cd genesis
sudo python2 genesis-panel

# (from outside the VM) When you are done working and want to exit...
vagrant halt

# Repeat steps 2 and 3 each time you want to log back into your development environment.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To run Genesis as a daemon instead of live in stdout, use <code>sudo python2 genesis-panel -d</code>, then <code>sudo python2 genesis-panel -s</code> to stop the daemon when you are done. Code is located in the <code>genesis</code> subfolder in the home folder for your default user. Any modifications to core or plugin code in this folder will be reloaded when you restart the Genesis process.</p>

<h3>Testing Webapps</h3>
<p>In order to access webapps hosted in your Vagrant machine on your host system, you will need to add forwarded ports to your Vagrantfile before you start the machine. To do this, add these statements right before the <code>end</code> of your Vagrantfile:</p>
{% highlight text %}
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, host: 80, guest: 80
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, host: 443, guest: 443
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The numbers you choose here will correspond to the ports to connect to on the host and guest, respectively. Choose the same port numbers when setting up a website through Genesis, and you will be able to access it on your host machine via <code>http://localhost:port</code>.</p>
