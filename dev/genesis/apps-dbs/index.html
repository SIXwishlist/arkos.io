            <dd>Arguments passed: the path on the hard disk where the app source was installed/extracted to, the full path to the certificate file, and the full path to the certificate key file.

          <dt>ssl_disable</dt>
            <dd>Argument passed: the user&#8217;s chosen name for the webapp. This function is called when a user unassigns the SSL certificate to the webapp, and SSL is intended to be disabled. Typically used to remove &#8220;force SSL&#8221; features in webapp configuration files.</dd>
          <dt>update</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: path, pkg, ver. This function is called when a site is set to be updated by Genesis (rather than updating itself), when there is an update available, and the user clicks the &#8220;Update&#8221; button. This function must properly unpack the new source at <code>pkg</code> and put it into place at <code>path</code> according to the app type&#8217;s specific upgrade instructions, and to execute any additional operation that the app requires on updates. The <code>ver</code> parameter includes the version of the site pre-update, so the function can execute different operations depending on the version being updated from.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The following is a more expansive explanation of the required functions.</p>
        <h3>pre_install</h3>
        <p><code>pre_install</code> is typically used to validate optional form data that is required with your application. You can do this with the <code>vars</code> object that is passed as an argument to this function. Like as follows:</p>
{% highlight python %}
dbname = vars.getvalue('wp-dbname', '')
if ' ' in dbname or '-' in dbname:
    raise Exception('Database name must not contain spaces or dashes')
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>To provide this optional form data, include a file called <code>layout/conf.xml</code> in your plugin directory that resembles the following.</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<xml>
  <label text="All of these options are OPTIONAL, if you do not choose them, then they will be automatically generated for you on install." />
  <formline text="Database Name" help="A database user with full rights on this database will be created of the same name.">
      <textinput name="wp-dbname" id="wp-dbname" />
  </formline>
  <formline text="Database User Password">
      <textinput name="wp-dbpasswd" id="wp-dbpasswd" password="True" />
  </formline>
</xml>
{% endhighlight %}
        <h3>post_install</h3>
        <p><code>post_install</code> is run after the app source is extracted, and is where the heavy lifting happens. Any install configurations required for your app generally will occur here.</p>
        <p>We will use extracts from the WordPress webapp&#8217;s <code>post_install</code> as a guide. First, we need to register a database</p>
{% highlight python %}
# Get the database object and connection, and determine proper values
dbase = apis.databases(self.app).get_interface('MariaDB')
conn = apis.databases(self.app).get_dbconn('MariaDB')
...
# Request a database and user to interact with it
dbase.add(dbname, conn)
dbase.usermod(dbname, 'add', passwd, conn)
dbase.chperm(dbname, dbname, 'grant', conn)
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Here we make calls to the Databases framework to give us a database with the specified name, to give us a database user with the specified name and password, then to grant all access on our new database to our new user. The <code>conn</code> object here is a secure database connection that the user already established when logging into Genesis.</p>
        <p>Now that we have our database, we will write WordPress&#8217; initial configuration file. We know where this is because <code>post_install</code> is passed the <code>path</code> variable, which is the full path on disk to the source install location.</p>
{% highlight python %}
# Write a standard WordPress config file
f = open(os.path.join(path, 'wp-config.php'), 'w')
f.write('&lt;?php\n'
    'define(\'DB_NAME\', \''+dbname+'\');\n'
    'define(\'DB_USER\', \''+dbname+'\');\n'
    'define(\'DB_PASSWORD\', \''+passwd+'\');\n'
    'define(\'DB_HOST\', \'localhost\');\n'
    ...
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>Any other operations necessary for the installation, from permissions changes to activating PHP ini modules, should take place here.</p>
        <h3>pre_remove</h3>
        <p>This function is called before the application source code is removed, and is good for stopping services or removing the databases before the source is actually removed. The path is passed in as an argument but the database names are not known (as these could have been changed manually since install), so you will need to parse the app&#8217;s configuration files to get the current database and user names.</p>
{% highlight python %}
dbase = apis.databases(self.app).get_interface('MariaDB')
conn = apis.databases(self.app).get_dbconn('MariaDB')
dbase.remove(dbname, conn)
dbase.usermod(dbname, 'del', '', conn)
{% endhighlight %}
        <h3>post_remove</h3>
        <p>This function is called after the source of the application is removed, reserved if any cleanup needs to happen after this point. Largely symbolic as most important removal work should have taken place in <code>pre_remove</code>.</p>
        <h3>ssl_enable</h3>
        <p>This function is called when SSL is added to this site&#8217;s configuration. All of the necessary steps in nginx are handled by Genesis, but if there are any special settings needed in your webapp itself, like setting force SSL, those can occur here. This is what that looks like in the WordPress plugin:</p>
{% highlight python %}
ic = open(os.path.join(path, 'wp-config.php'), 'r').readlines()
f = open(os.path.join(path, 'wp-config.php'), 'w')
oc = []
found = False
for l in ic:
    if 'define(\'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN\'' in l:
        l = 'define(\'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN\', false);\n'
        oc.append(l)
        found = True
    else:
        oc.append(l)
if found == False:
    oc.append('define(\'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN\', true);\n')
f.writelines(oc)
f.close()
{% endhighlight %}
        <h3>ssl_disable</h3>
        <p>Fairly self-explanatory; called when SSL is unassigned from the plugin and SSL should be removed from your webapp&#8217;s configurations.</p>

          <dt>connect</dt>
            <dd>Required for authenticated database engines. Arguments passed: a session instance (<code>self.app.session</code>) for storing the access rights, the username for authenticating, the password for authenticating, and the database name if a specific database is to be used when connecting. Executed when a user or a Genesis plugin requires any option of an authenticated database engine, and there is no active connection.</dd>
          <dt>checkpwstat</dt>
            <dd>Required for authenticated database engines. Attempt to connect to the database type with no username or password (to verify if a root/master password is set). Return False if there is no root/master password set, or return True if a master password is properly set.</dd>
          <dt>chpwstat</dt>
            <dd>Required for authenticated database engines. Arguments passed: the new master password, and the connection object (if present). Change the root/master username and password for this database engine.</dd>
          <dt>validate</dt>
            <dd><em>Optional.</em> Arguments passed: the user&#8217;s chosen name for the database, the username, the password, and the connection object (if present/required). A place to check for compatibility of the user&#8217;s chosen username/password/database name to make sure they fit with your particular backend&#8217;s naming requirements or conventions.</dd>
          <dt>add</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the user&#8217;s chosen name for the database, and the connection object (if present/required). Executed when a user or a Genesis plugin requests a new database. Should fully add and enable said database.</dd>
          <dt>remove</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the database name, and the connection object (if present/required). Executed when a user or Genesis plugin deletes an available database. Should completely disable and remove said database.</dd>
          <dt>usermod</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the database user name, the action to complete, the database user password, and the connection object (if present/required). Action is either &#8216;add&#8217;, which should create the username and assign the password given; or &#8216;del&#8217;, which should drop the database user entirely.</dd>
          <dt>chperm</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the database name, the database username, the action to perform, and the connection object (if present/required). Action is either &#8216;check&#8217;, which should return a list of the database user&#8217;s permissions in string format; &#8216;grant&#8217;, which should grant all permissions to the database user on the named database, or &#8216;revoke&#8217;, which should revoke all privileges for the database user on the named database.</dd>
          <dt>execute</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the database name, the database command, and the connection object (if present/required). This function should execute SQL command(s) passed as argument on the named database, and return the output in string format.</dd>
          <dt>get_dbs</dt>
            <dd>Returns a list of dictionaries, one for each database of the same type on the system. The dictionaries must have the following keys: &#8216;name&#8217; &#8211; the database name; &#8216;type&#8217; &#8211; the database type (e.g. &#8216;MariaDB&#8217;); and &#8216;class&#8217; &#8211; a reference to the class of the database type itself, from here just <code>self.__class__</code>.</dd>
          <dt>get_users</dt>
            <dd>Returns a list of dictionaries, one for each database user of the same type on the system. The dictionaries must have the following keys: &#8216;name&#8217; &#8211; the database name; &#8216;type&#8217; &#8211; the database type (e.g. &#8216;MariaDB&#8217;); and &#8216;class&#8217; &#8211; a reference to the class of the database type itself, from here just <code>self.__class__</code>.</dd>
          <dt>get_size</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the database name, and the connection object (if present/required). Must return a string showing the physical size on disk of the database (good to return the utility function <code>str_fsize(float)</code> passing in your value).</dd>
          <dt>dump</dt>
            <dd>Arguments passed: the database name, and the connection object (if present/required). Must return a dump of the specified database as a properly formatted string.</dd>
