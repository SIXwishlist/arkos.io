  <p> <strong>Warning</strong> &#8211; arkOS and its constituent software are still in development. Many tools are not yet working, and you should not yet depend on arkOS for anything other than testing at this time. Please stay connected via one of the methods listed on the <a href="/about/contact">Contact</a> page to get updates on project development.</p>

<p class="lead">arkOS is a system for securely self-hosting your online life from the comfort of your home.</p>
<p>It is a flavour of <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org">Arch Linux ARM</a> with a focus on easy self-hosting of a variety of content. It allows you to easily host your own website, email, &#8220;cloud&#8221; and more, all within arm&#8217;s reach. It does this by interfacing with existing software and allowing the user to easily update and change settings with a graphical interface. No more need to depend on external cloud services, which can be insecure &#8220;walled gardens&#8221; that require you to give up control over your data.</p>
<p>arkOS will have several different components that come together to make a seamless self-hosting experience possible on your embedded device or dedicated server. Each of these components will work with each other out-of-the-box, allowing you to host your websites, email, social networking accounts, cloud services, and many other things from your arkOS node.</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Built for embedded devices.</h3>
    <p>arkOS is primarily an operating system for embedded devices. In fact, arkOS was initially designed for use on the Raspberry Pi, which is a simple single-board computer not much bigger than a credit card. Embedded devices are prized for their relatively low cost (usually less than $100), their availability, and their general-purpose nature. Other embedded devices boast more impressive specifications, enabling you to pay only for the performance you need. Choose the device that works best for you!</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Easy to set up.</h3>
    <p>Download one of our easy installation programs and run it on your home computer. It will guide you through the process of downloading and installing arkOS to whichever type of media your embedded device supports. Setting up a home server couldn&#8217;t be simpler.</p>

    <p>Plug the installation media into your device, plug the device into your home router, and you&#8217;re ready to host your own files, sites and cloud data. arkOS works right out of the box. Connect to the device via your home computer, and finish installing and customizing your arkOS node.</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Genesis &#8212; the home for your self-hosted web.</h3>
    <p>Genesis is an application that allows you to add, remove, modify and customize the different facets of your arkOS node. From here, you can easily install plugins and server apps, upload files, manage your cloud, update your system and much more. You can monitor the health of your system and get alerts if a problem occurs. Genesis can even back up your information and store it in case you make a mistake.</p>

<h2>The Distribution</h2>
<p>arkOS comes with a custom Linux distribution for embedded devices, based on <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org">Arch Linux ARM</a>. In layman&#8217;s terms, it is just like any other operating system that you might have on your home computer (like Windows or Mac OS X), that allows you to run server software. You don&#8217;t need to know anything about Linux to use arkOS, however, as most of its functions are managed via Genesis, the easy-to-use graphical management app. </p>
<p>arkOS focuses on barebones server performance on embedded devices. It aims to be as lightweight as possible, keeping the Pi’s precious resources for running server software, like it should be. It uses the Pacman package installation system and systemd management daemon. arkOS hosts its own package repositories, so that any updates or extra software can be easily found and downloaded from a reliable source. Its repository will include the best server software for use on the Pi, ones that prioritize lightweight performance for the most efficient operation possible. Its update cycle prioritizes stability and security over constant updates, which allows us to develop the other arkOS projects more easily in tandem with the OS.</p>
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<p>Genesis is the crowning feature of arkOS, your gateway to your decentralized web: a one-stop shop where you can modify your node, add new shares, set up new web sites or networking profiles, and customize any running servers. The limited hardware set of embedded devices is actually one of its greatest assets: not having to plan around such a huge variety of potential hardware/software drivers and configurations means that the focus can be made on a truly easy-to-use operating environment. This is what makes the Genesis’ one-stop approach possible. Similar things have been done before, with services like Webmin, FreeNAS’s web interface, etc. Genesis brings the best elements from each of these conceptions together to create a truly unique and easy experience for managing content on your embedded device. It is locally-run on the Pi, accessible from throughout your home network.</p>
<p>Developers can create installation scripts and plugins that can be merged into Genesis. This allows anyone that produces a new server software or technology to easily have their project installed and maintained with an arkOS node.</p>
<p>Genesis was originally a fork of the <a href="https://ajenti.org">Ajenti</a> web interface.</p>
